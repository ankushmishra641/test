Follow These steps to perform tokenization:-
* Develop a Python script for token healing in natural language processing tasks.
* Implement a function to preprocess and clean tokens, improving their quality and consistency.
* Handle common tokenization issues such as misspellings, abbreviations, and punctuation.
* Utilize techniques such as spell checking and correction to improve token accuracy.
* Incorporate a dictionary-based approach to replace known incorrect tokens with correct ones.
* Implement a statistical language model to predict and replace out-of-vocabulary tokens.
* Explore techniques like lemmatization and stemming to normalize tokens.
* Consider context and semantic information to enhance token healing accuracy.
* Integrate external libraries or APIs for specific tasks like spell checking or language modeling.
* Provide options for customization and configuration based on userÂ requirements.
